# Tree-Leaf-Image-Classification

The objective of this project is to develop a model capable of accurately classifying trees within a botanical reserve based on both their type and health condition, using images of their leaves. To accomplish this, we have at our disposal a dataset comprising 4384 images spread across 22 categories.     

First, we'll train a standard CNN model and use its validation performance as a benchmark.     
Then, we'll explore regularization and data augmentation techniques in an effort to enhance the model's ability to generalize.       
Lastly, we'll leverage transfer learning by employing CNN models pre-trained on vast datasets.       

In practice, ideally we'd have thousands more images, sufficiently diverse and evenly distributed, to effectively train a model for 22-class image classification problem. Through this project, we will strive to achieve the best possible performance given the high number of classes and the relatively small size of our dataset.
